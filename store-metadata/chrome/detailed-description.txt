Lost in a sea of browser tabs? Organize them like you think.

Tab Canopy brings tree-based organization to your browser tabs. Unlike traditional tab managers that use flat lists or simple groups, Tab Canopy lets you nest tabs hierarchically - perfect for research, development workflows, and complex projects.

🌳 Why Tree Structure?

Your work isn't linear. You open a main article, then supporting sources, then references from those sources. Tab Canopy mirrors this natural workflow:

Research Project
├── Main Article
├── Supporting Sources
│   ├── Study 1
│   ├── Study 2
│   └── Background Info
└── Draft Document

✨ Key Features

• Drag & Drop Organization - Intuitive tree building with smooth drag-and-drop
• Side Panel Interface - Clean, always-accessible panel that doesn't clutter your screen
• Multi-Window Support - Manage tabs across all browser windows
• Real-time Sync - Changes sync instantly between browser and UI
• Privacy First - All data stays local in your browser. No cloud, no tracking.

🎯 Perfect For

• Researchers juggling multiple sources
• Developers with docs, code repos, and Stack Overflow
• Students organizing study materials
• Anyone who regularly works with 10+ tabs

• tabs: To read tab titles/URLs and manage positions
• sidePanel: To display the management interface

No host permissions. No access to page content. All data stored locally using IndexedDB.
